## Data Source

What data source did you work with?

BlueSky live-stream data

## Challenges / Obstacles

What challenges did this data choice present in data gathering, processing and analysis, and how did you work through them? What methods and tools did you use to work with this data?

Working with Bluesky data presented several challenges. Setting up Kafka and ensuring messages were reliably stored in DuckDB required careful configuration and debugging. Once the data pipeline was stable, performing sentiment analysis required exploring different tools and libraries to process text efficiently. Finally, using skills learned in design last semester, we created an interactive dashboard to visualize trends over time and highlight key topics.
